## üéØ Key Design Principles

### **Visual Phase Identification**
1. **Color-coded backgrounds** on all time series:
   - Green: Expansion (growing above average)
   - Red: Contraction (declining or below average)
   - Yellow: Transition/Peak
   - Gray: Stable/Neutral

2. **Phase indicators** calculated from:
   - Revenue growth rate vs 3-year average
   - Margin expansion/contraction
   - Cash flow trends
   - Working capital changes

### **Chart Annotations** (Future AI Enhancement)
- Placeholder for automatic annotations like:
  - "Margin expansion phase started Q3 2023"
  - "Revenue growth deceleration observed"
  - "Working capital improvement trend"
  - "Entering potential contraction phase"

### **Simple Interactions**
- Hover for exact values
- Click to drill down
- Drag to zoom time periods
- Toggle between quarterly/annual

### **Clean Layout**
```

### **Mobile Responsive**
- Stack sections vertically
- Swipeable time periods
- Collapsible sections
- Same visualizations, just reordered

## Focus Areas

This approach focuses on:
- **Time series everywhere** to show movement
- **Simple lines and bars** only
- **Clear phase identification** through colors
- **Easy comparisons** with overlaid lines
- **Future-ready for AI annotations**

## Visual Hierarchy

1. **Primary Focus**: Cycle identification through colored timeline backgrounds
2. **Secondary Focus**: Revenue/profit trends with dual-axis visualization
3. **Supporting Elements**: Margins, cash flows, and ratio timelines
4. **Comparison Mode**: Multi-company overlay with indexed performance

## Color Strategy

- **Phase Colors**: Green (expansion), Red (contraction), Yellow (transition), Gray (stable)
- **Data Colors**: Consistent pastel palette for different metrics
- **Emphasis Colors**: High contrast for important data points
- **Background**: Clean white with subtle grid lines
