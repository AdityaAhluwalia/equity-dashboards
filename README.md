# 📈 Equity Dashboard V1

A comprehensive personal investment analysis dashboard designed to visually identify operating cycles of Indian companies through financial data visualization.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This dashboard processes financial data from Screener.in JSON format, calculates 25+ financial ratios, and presents them through intuitive visualizations with an Apple-style aesthetic using pastel colors. The entire development follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Visual Cycle Identification**: Clearly show expansion/contraction phases through colored timeline backgrounds
- **Comprehensive Ratio Analysis**: Calculate and display 25+ financial ratios over 12 years and 12 quarters  
- **Multi-Company Comparison**: Compare up to 10 companies simultaneously with overlaid visualizations
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintain complete historical data with monthly updates
- **Mobile-First Design**: Fully responsive interface optimized for all devices
- **Test-Driven Quality**: >90% test coverage with TDD methodology

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
