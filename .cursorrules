# 🚀 AI Dev Tasks for Cursor 🤖

Welcome to **AI Dev Tasks**! This workspace uses a structured approach to feature development with built-in checkpoints for verification.

## Workflow: From Idea to Implemented Feature 💡➡️💻

### 1️⃣ Create a Product Requirement Document (PRD)
Use `@create-prd.mdc` to generate a detailed PRD:
```
Use @create-prd.mdc
Here's the feature I want to build: [Describe your feature in detail]
Reference these files to help you: [Optional: @file1.py @file2.ts]
```

### 2️⃣ Generate Your Task List from the PRD
Use `@generate-tasks.mdc` to create implementation tasks:
```
Now take @MyFeature-PRD.md and create tasks using @generate-tasks.mdc
```

### 3️⃣ Process Tasks Step-by-Step
Use `@process-task-list.mdc` for methodical implementation:
```
Please start on task 1.1 and use @process-task-list.mdc
```

## ✨ Core Principles

1. **Structured Development:** Clear process from idea to code
2. **Step-by-Step Verification:** Review and approve each step
3. **Manages Complexity:** Break down large features into digestible tasks
4. **Clear Progress Tracking:** Visual representation of completed tasks

## 🗂️ Workflow Files

- **`create-prd.mdc`**: Guides AI in generating Product Requirement Documents
- **`generate-tasks.mdc`**: Breaks down PRDs into detailed task lists
- **`process-task-list.mdc`**: Manages task implementation one step at a time

## 💡 Best Practices

- Be specific in feature descriptions
- Use MAX mode for comprehensive PRD generation
- Review and approve each task completion
- Maintain clear file organization in `/tasks` directory
- Always wait for approval before proceeding to next task

## File Organization

- PRDs: `/tasks/prd-[feature-name].md`
- Task Lists: `/tasks/tasks-[prd-file-name].md`
- Keep relevant files list updated as you work
