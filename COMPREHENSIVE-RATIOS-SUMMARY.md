## 📊 **Master Financial Ratios List - IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Universal Ratios (11 ratios) - All Company Types**

#### **Valuation Ratios (4)**
✅ **Price-to-Earnings (P/E)** = Stock Price ÷ EPS
✅ **Price-to-Book (P/B)** = Stock Price ÷ Book Value per Share  
✅ **Price-to-Sales (P/S)** = Market Cap ÷ Annual Revenue
✅ **Market Cap to Cash Flow** = Market Cap ÷ Operating Cash Flow

#### **Growth Ratios (4)**
✅ **Revenue Growth (1Y)** = (Current - Previous) ÷ Previous × 100
✅ **Revenue Growth (2Y CAGR)** = (End ÷ Start)^(1/2) - 1
✅ **Profit Growth (1Y)** = (Current - Previous) ÷ Previous × 100
✅ **EPS Growth (1Y)** = (Current - Previous) ÷ Previous × 100

#### **Efficiency Ratios (3)**
✅ **Return on Equity (ROE)** = Net Income ÷ Shareholders Equity × 100
✅ **Asset Turnover** = Revenue ÷ Total Assets
✅ **Return on Assets (ROA)** = Net Income ÷ Total Assets × 100

### **2. Profitability Ratios (4 ratios)**
✅ **Net Profit Margin** = Net Income ÷ Revenue × 100
✅ **Free Cash Flow Margin** = FCF ÷ Revenue × 100
✅ **Market P/E Ratio** = From market data (validation)
✅ **Dividend Yield** = From market data (validation)

### **3. Leverage Ratios (4 ratios)**
✅ **Debt-to-Equity** = Total Debt ÷ Shareholders Equity
✅ **Debt-to-Assets** = Total Debt ÷ Total Assets
✅ **Equity Ratio** = Shareholders Equity ÷ Total Assets
✅ **Current Ratio** = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities

### **4. Cash Flow Ratios (3 ratios)**
✅ **Operating Cash Flow Margin** = OCF ÷ Revenue × 100
✅ **Cash Conversion Efficiency** = OCF ÷ Net Income
✅ **Free Cash Flow Validation** = Trend analysis across periods

### **5. Quality & Consistency Metrics (3 ratios)**
✅ **Earnings Quality Score** = OCF ÷ Net Income (with quality bands)
✅ **Revenue Volatility** = Standard deviation of growth rates
✅ **Margin Consistency** = Stability analysis across quarters

## 💡 **Technical Insights**

### **Data Structure Learnings**:
- **Share counts** in lakhs need conversion for EPS calculations
- **Balance sheet equation** validation critical for data quality
- **Sector-specific fields** require different calculation approaches
- **Real data variance** requires flexible precision expectations

### **Ratio Calculation Insights**:
